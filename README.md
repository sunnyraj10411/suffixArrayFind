# Suffix Array Construction and Exact Pattern Matching 

## Introduction
Suffix array is a sorted arrays of all the suffixes of a string. It was proposed by Manber and Myers in 1990. Suffix arrays were proposed as an space efficient alternative to suffix trees. Some of the popular usage of suffix arrays are for pattern matching, text compression, bioinformatics, regular expression matching etc. Here, we will discuss exact pattern matching using suffix arrays. We discuss the implementation of the following algorithms in this paper: 
1. Suffic array construction.
2. Lcp array construction from suffix array.
3. Lcp binary tree construction.
4. Exact pattern matching using suffix arrays.
